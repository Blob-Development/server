Easy-to-use, customizable, secured, up-to-date and minimalist.

## Documentations
Coming Soon.

## Getting Started
This project runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v14.16.0/). Please make sure that everything is up-to-date.

You can install the dependencies/packages by running:

Currently, every recent changes will changed automatically, purge the cache every 24 hours (default, you can change it)

## Files
We put our **files** in the folder, and create a new subdirectory again.

```

For testing/development mode, you can use:
```shell script

This OSS also still needs a lot of improvement.
